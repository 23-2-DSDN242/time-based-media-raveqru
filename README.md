## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README
*THE IDEA:
The idea behind this project is that the less time we have , the faster we act and make decisions. In this context, actions are depicted by stick figures. Hours are the  slowest, followed by minutes, and seconds are the fastest, with the stick figure noticeably moving faster than in other time units. The circles represent a target/goal.
Clock displayed on the desktop serves as a visual representation of work.

*Manual:
---> When alarm IS SET= the clock changes colour to dark blue
--->When 5 SECONDS LEFT before alarm rings=Opacity Changes from 0-255 
--->When ALARM RINGS (for 10 sec)= clock colours change from purple to dark blue on odd seconds

--->When AM= white cat
--->When PM = Black cat 

--->Lines sections 
The section on the circles also represent time units:
Small circle = 60 seconds = 60 lines
Middle circle= Short lines = 60 lines = 60 minutes , Long Lines = 12 =  minutes with step 5 
Big circle= !2 lines = 12 hours.
